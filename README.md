# RNA-seq Exploratory Data Analysis (GSE302199)

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of RNA-seq data from the GEO dataset **GSE302199**.

## Project scope
The goal of this project was to:
- explore gene expression variability across samples
- assess biological signal relative to background variability
- apply statistical summaries and visualization to support biological interpretation

The analysis focuses on understanding data structure and variability rather than differential expression testing.

## Methods
- Quality control and exploratory analysis
- Visualization of expression distributions and variability
- Reproducible analysis using Python

## Tools
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- matplotlib / seaborn

## Data
The RNA-seq data were obtained from GEO:

Raw data are not included in this repository.

## Status
Completed as an independent portfolio project during MSc studies.
